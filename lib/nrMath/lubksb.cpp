/* Solves the set of n linear equations AÂ·X = B. Here a[1..n][1..n] is input, not as the matrix
   A but rather as its LU decomposition, determined by the routine ludcmp . indx[1..n] is input
   as the permutation vector returned by ludcmp . b[1..n] is input as the right-hand side vector
   B, and returns with the solution vector X. a , n , and indx are not modified by this routine
   and can be left in place for successive calls with different right-hand sides b . This routine takes
   into account the possibility that b will begin with many zero elements, so it is efficient for use
   in matrix inversion. */
